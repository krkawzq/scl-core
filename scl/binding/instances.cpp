/// @brief Template Instantiation (Empty - All Functions are Inline)
///
/// SCL kernels use SCL_FORCE_INLINE for all template functions,
/// which means they are instantiated at the call site in user code.
///
/// No explicit instantiation is needed. This file is kept for:
/// 1. Build system consistency
/// 2. Future non-inline functions
/// 3. Compilation test placeholder
///
/// For C ABI exports, see c_api.cpp
// =============================================================================

// Intentionally empty - all kernels are header-only with force inline
